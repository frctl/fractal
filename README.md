## Current project status - please read!

Changes in Fractal's core team mean that new development on this project is currently somewhat restricted. Please see [issue #449](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/issues/449) ('An update on Fractal's future development') for more details about how we are hoping Fractal can move forwards in the future.

Currently The 1.x (master) branch is stable and is being used in many projects. Documentation for this version is available at https://fractal.build. The 2.0 (beta) branch is _not_ recommended for use as there are many outstanding issues + bugs, limited documentation and no active development at this time.

**We are looking for developers and maintainers! Please add a comment to [issue #449](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/issues/449) if you are interested in helping out with Fractal's future development.**

## Introduction

Component (or pattern) libraries are a way of designing and building websites in a modular fashion, breaking up the UI into small, reusable chunks that can then later be assembled in a variety of ways to build anything from larger components right up to whole pages.

Fractal helps you assemble, preview and document website component libraries, and then integrate them into your web sites, apps and build processes to create joined up, 'living' projects.

Fractal can be run from the command line or integrated into your project via its API.

Check out the the [Fractal documentation](http://fractal.build/guide) for more information.

## Demo

There is no 'official' demo for Fractal up yet, but [bits.24ways.org](http://bits.24ways.org) (repository: https://github.com/24ways/frontend) is an excellent example of a component library built on Fractal. Kudos to [@paulrobertlloyd](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd) for his great work!

## Requirements

Fractal requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v4.4.7+

It is the intention that Fractal’s Node.js version support will track the latest Node LTS release version.

## Testing

Fractal is a project that has recently evolved rapidly and organically from a proof-of-concept prototype into a more stable, mature tool. Because of this it's currently pretty far behind where it should be in terms of test coverage. Any contributions on this front would be most welcome!

Existing tests can be run using the `npm test` command.
