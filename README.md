## Introduction

Component (or pattern) libraries are a way of designing and building websites in a modular fashion, breaking up the UI into small, reusable chunks that can then later be assembled in a variety of ways to build anything from larger components right up to whole pages.

Fractal helps you assemble, preview and document website component libraries, and then integrate them into your web sites, apps and build processes to create joined up, 'living' projects.

Fractal can be run from the command line or integrated into your project via its API.

Check out the the [Fractal documentation](http://fractal.build/guide) for more information.

## Demo

There is no 'official' demo for Fractal up yet, but [bits.24ways.org](http://bits.24ways.org) (repository: https://github.com/24ways/frontend) is an excellent example of a component library built on Fractal. Kudos to [@paulrobertlloyd](https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd) for his great work!

## Requirements

Any LTS (Long-term stable) version of NodeJS. At the time of writing this is 6 (Boron) and 8 (Carbon).

If you're on an earlier (unsupported) version of NodeJS, then see the below compatibility table.

| NodeJS version | Fractal version |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 4.x            | 1.1.7           |
| 5.x            | 1.1.7           |

## Testing

Fractal is a project that has recently evolved rapidly and organically from a proof-of-concept prototype into a more stable, mature tool. Because of this it's currently pretty far behind where it should be in terms of test coverage. Any contributions on this front would be most welcome!

Existing tests can be run using the `npm test` command.

## Contributing

Fractal has an active group of contributors but we are always looking for more help. If you are interested in contributing then please come and say hi on [Fractal's Slack workspace](https://slack.fractal.build/) - or of course we will always welcome pull requests on any of the [frctl organisation](https://github.com/frctl) repos.

Please note we have a [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
