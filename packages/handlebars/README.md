# Handlebars Adapter

Use Handlebars templates with Fractal.

This is the default template engine adapter for Fractal and does not need to be installed separately. See the Fractal [template engine documentation](https://github.com/frctl/fractal/blob/master/docs/engines/overview.md) for details on use and customisation.
